  <br/><strong>
 New York bagels are the best. Deal with it. The legend, according to old city folk, including Larry King, is that there's just something in the water.
    In distinction, the "New York bagel" contains salt and malt and is boiled in water before baking in a standard oven. The resulting bagel is puffy with a moist crust.</strong>

<strong><Blue>Chewy Texture </strong>
<h4>At its most basic, traditional bagel dough contains wheat flour (without germ or bran), salt, water, and yeast leavening. Bread flour or other high gluten flours are preferred to create the firm and dense but spongy bagel shape and chewy texture. Most bagel recipes call for the addition of a sweetener to the dough, often barley malt (syrup or crystals), honey, high fructose corn syrup, sugar, with or without eggs, milk or butter. Leavening can be accomplished using either a sourdough technique or using commercially produced yeast.
Bagels are traditionally made by: <p>
<p>

•    mixing and kneading the ingredients to form the dough<p>
•    shaping the dough into the traditional bagel shape, round with a hole in the middle, from a long thin piece of dough<p>
•    proofing the bagels for at least 12 hours at low temperature (40–50 °F = 4.5–10 °C) <p>
•    boiling each bagel in water that may or may not contain additives such as lye, baking soda, barley malt syrup, or honey<p>
•    baking at between 175 °C and 315 °C (about 350–600 °F)
